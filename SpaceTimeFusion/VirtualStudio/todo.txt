- pick right smoothing value before segmentation
- use edges in mean shift segmentation
- auto determine noise in images
- use structure from motion points to change datacosts
- update visual studio
- make constants sensitivite to half size - i.e. STEREO_OccDepthThreshold
- weigh each color channel differently
- data costs - squaring when col is between 0-1 is not the same as 0 - 255
- data costs - sample errors, use bilinear interpol?
